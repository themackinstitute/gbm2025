## 📄 Overview
This repository accompanies the preprint:
> **"Preclinical Investigation of Resveratrol and CAR-Macrophage Synergy for IDH1-Mutant Glioblastoma: An AI-Driven, Multi-Scale Modelling Rationale and Protocol"**  
> McNab A, The Mack Institute (2025)

The manuscript outlines a novel AI-driven, multi-scale in silico modelling framework that predicts a **93% reduction in glioblastoma volume** using an unexplored therapeutic combination: **Resveratrol + CAR-Macrophages**. This repository will host simulation parameters, core model logic, and reproducibility support files.
