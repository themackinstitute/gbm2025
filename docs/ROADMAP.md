# GBM2025 Model – Roadmap & Supplementary Notes

This repository supports the preprint:

**“Preclinical Investigation of Resveratrol and CAR-Macrophage Synergy for IDH1-Mutant Glioblastoma: An AI-Driven, Multi-Scale Modelling Rationale and Protocol”**  
by Angus McNab, The Mack Institute (2025)  
→ OSF Preprint: [link coming soon]

## 📦 Repository Contents

- `code/`  
  Includes Python and CompuCell3D scripts for:
  - Agent-Based Model (ABM)
  - Reaction-Diffusion Module
  - ODE-driven metabolic model
  - Integration logic and synergy analysis

- `data/`  
  Reference files and simulated inputs (e.g., oxygen gradients, Resveratrol profiles)

- `results/`  
  Output files and key plots (e.g., tumour reduction heatmaps, synergy indices)

- `docs/`  
  Supporting material: roadmap, references, and supplementary tables

---

## 🔬 Reproducibility Plan

- Code will be uploaded in stages:
  - Initial upload: structured folders and templates
  - Stage 2: scripts for best-case run and synergy simulation
  - Stage 3: full parameter sweep with Monte Carlo batch logic

- All parameters and assumptions will be documented in `docs/parameters.csv`.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Release reproducible runs (best-case, synergy, sensitivity)
- Upload annotated CompuCell3D XML/Steppable files
- Package results in `results/` for reproduction and comparison
- Develop interactive viewer (TBD, future phase)
